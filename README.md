# Mindset Analysis Using Psychometric Analysis (MAP-G)
Mindset Analysis using Psychometric Games (Map-G) is an application developed with the objective of using Psychometric games to quantify,evaluate and analyze favourable traits for teachers/professors.

This is in line with the Psychometric tests and platforms that tech and other companies have started to employ to get a psychometric analysis of their prospective candidates. It was envisioned as a research project across the domains of Computer Science, Psychology and Software Engineering, and has since grown to become a fully functioning application.
